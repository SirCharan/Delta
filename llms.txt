This repository contains a Python-based test suite for the Delta Exchange API. The main file is delta_api_test.py which implements a comprehensive testing framework for various Delta Exchange API endpoints.

Key components:
1. DeltaExchangeAPITester class that handles:
   - API authentication and request signing
   - Endpoint testing for products, tickers, wallet balances, positions, and orders
   - Order placement and management
   - Detailed logging and error handling

The code demonstrates:
- Secure API key handling
- HMAC-SHA256 signature generation
- REST API interaction patterns
- Error handling and logging best practices
- Test automation for cryptocurrency exchange APIs

The implementation uses Python 3.10+ and the requests library for HTTP communication. It includes comprehensive logging and follows security best practices for API key management.

This codebase serves as both a practical implementation and a reference for:
- Cryptocurrency exchange API integration
- API authentication patterns
- Test automation for financial APIs
- Error handling in API clients
