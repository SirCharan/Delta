This repository contains a comprehensive Python-based integration suite for the Delta Exchange API. The codebase is structured into several key components:

1. API Test Suite (delta_api_test.py):
   - Implements a complete testing framework for Delta Exchange API endpoints
   - Handles API authentication and request signing
   - Provides detailed logging and error handling
   - Tests market data, trading, and account management features

2. MCP Server (server.py):
   - Implements a Model-Controller-Provider interface for Delta Exchange API
   - Provides async request handling and tool-based API access
   - Includes comprehensive error handling and logging
   - Manages API credentials securely

3. Official Client Test (delta_official_test.py):
   - Tests connectivity with the India endpoint
   - Verifies API credentials and basic functionality
   - Tests balance and order management features

Key Technical Features:
- HMAC-SHA256 signature generation for API authentication
- Async HTTP request handling with httpx
- Environment variable configuration for credentials
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Type hints and parameter validation
- Modular and extensible architecture

The codebase demonstrates:
- Secure API key handling and request signing
- REST API interaction patterns
- Error handling and logging best practices
- Test automation for financial APIs
- Async programming patterns
- Tool-based API access patterns

This implementation serves as both a practical tool and a reference for:
- Cryptocurrency exchange API integration
- API authentication patterns
- Test automation for financial APIs
- Error handling in API clients
- Async programming in Python
- MCP server implementation
